/*! \brief Manages a flow meter who pulses on a digital input pin during flow.
 *
 *  We use a flow meter for determining the total volume that flowed
 *  during an arbitrary interval. To determine the flow rate, numerical
 *  integration must be employed. However, for the total volume, the
 *  math involved is much simpler. The total volume is proportional to
 *  the number of pulses counted. See #calibrate for more details.
 *
 *  Calibrating your flow meter is recommended. Do this by allowing
 *  liquid to flow through the flow meter. Collect this liquid for
 *  measurement. Count the number of pulses generated by the flow meter
 *  during the flow. The value of interested is computed by the
 *  following formula:
 *                           k = V / C
 * 
 *  You can run this calibration a number of times to find the average
 *  value (if you're feeling so keen).
 *
 *  \see #calibrate
